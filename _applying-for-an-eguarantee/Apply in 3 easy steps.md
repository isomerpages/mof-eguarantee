# Step 1
**Review eGuarantee purchase instructions from Agencies**

Agencies will provide instructions on how to fill up your eGuarantee application. To purchase an eGuarantee from Financial Institutions [click here](/financial-institutions/). To view the list of eGuarantee templates in use currently [click here](/templates/List-of-eGuarantee-templates/existing/).


# Step 2
**Financial Institutions will process your application and send the eGuarantee to Agencies via the NTP**

After purchasing an eGuarantee from Financial Institutions, your eGuarantee will be sent from the Financial Institution to the Agency directly. 

Financial Institutions will inform you that your eGuarantee has been issued, there is no need for you to collect the eGuarantee and transmit it to the Agency.

# Step 3
**Agency will process your eGuarantee**

Agency will inform Financial Institution or you if there are any issues with the eGuarantee. If otherwise, the eGuarantee is live and in effect.
