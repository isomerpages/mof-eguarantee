# What are Guarantees?
When transacting with the Government, guarantees are issued by Financial Institutions as an undertaking that the business or individual will fulfill its contractual or licensing obligations to the Government. 

Guarantees are used by the Government:
* As security deposits and tender deposits for procurement, revenue and land sales contracts; and
* For licensing purposes, e.g. foreign worker permits, employment agency licensing, dog breed licensing, GST registration, etc.

eGuarantee@Gov is working to digitalise guarantees used by the Government. Please refer to LINK for more details on guarantees that have been digitalised under eGuarantee@Gov.
