# Introduction to Purpose of Guarantee Texts

The Purpose of Guarantee data field (i.e. PURP_GUA) is used to provide a brief description of the context in which the Guarantee is being provided. Agencies will only use this data field for "many-to-one" scenario. 

"Many-to-one" scenario pertains to a scenario when more than one guarantee are tied to a single contract/ licensing application. Hence, PURP_GUA is used to differentiate the different guarantees under the same contract/ licensing application.

This field will be left blank for "one-to-one" scenario. "One-to-one" scenario pertains to a scenario when only one guarantee is tied to a single contract/ licensing application. 

If you are unsure, please approach Agencies on the Purpose of Guarantee text to be used for your eGuarantee.
