# Frequently Asked Questions


### Why should I apply for an eGuarantee instead of a paper guarantee?

You may enjoy a faster lodgement process. Typically, it takes you up to 5-7 days from application to delivery of the guarantee to the Agency. With eGuarantee@Gov, the application and issuance process can be completed within a day. You can also enjoy cost savings as there is no longer a need to collect the paper guarantee from the bank or insurance company and deliver them to the Agency.

### What type of eGuarantee can I apply for?

You can apply for guarantees for i) procurement of general goods and services and construction services, ii) revenue contracts, iii) land sale tenders, and iv) licensing obligations/ regulatory requirements. Please approach the Agency you are dealing with to find out the type of eGuarantee it requires.

### How do I check on the status of my eGuarantee? Who should I contact regarding the status of my eGuarantee application.

The bank or insurance company will inform you that it has issued the eGuarantee. Once your eGuarantee has been lodged successfully, the Agency will inform you on the next step of your procurement, revenue contracts, land sale tenders or licensing process. You may contact the Agency regarding the status of your eGuarantee if it has been lodged successfully.
